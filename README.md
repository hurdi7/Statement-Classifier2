# Review Classifier Using Similarity Scores

A unique approach to classify reviews (mental-health-based) using **text similarity** instead of traditional supervised classifiers.

## Project Overview

This project implements a review sentiment classifier using **cosine similarity** of input reviews against prototypical "positive" and "negative" review sets. It leverages NLP-based preprocessing, vectorization, and similarity computation to assign a sentiment score to unseen reviews.

## Approach

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering, stemming
2. **Vectorization**
   - CountVectorizer to convert text into feature vectors
3. **Similarity Score Computation**
   - Calculate cosine similarity of a new review with known review samples
4. **Classification Logic**
   - Assign label based on which class the new review is more similar to
